# Prototype pattern
Prototype is creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependant on their classes.
We use it when we want to create new objects by cloning other objects.
It is good to use this pattern when creating new objects requires more resources than you want or have available. You can save resources
just by coping existing objects that are already in memory.
