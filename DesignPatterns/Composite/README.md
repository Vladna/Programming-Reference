# Composite pattern
Composite pattern is structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were
individual objects.
Composite pattern provides two basic element types that share a common interface: simple leaves and complex containers.
A container can be composed of both leaves and other containers. This lets you construct a nested recursive object structure that resembles a tree.
